This is a fork of [jnsh/arc-theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme), that by itself is a fork of the original and not mantained anymore [horst3180/arc-theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

Arc Neon is a Gnome Shell flat theme with transparent elements and support for popular applications.

**NOTICE:** I'm not mantaining this, I recommend the use of the upstream theme instead of this fork due to it being actively mantained and widespread available in the repos of popular distros. Changes are subtle and you can copy my extra themes to complement it.

## Changes from upstream
+ Improved top bar readability 
+ Made opaque elements subtly transparent
+ Improved Chromium theme
+ Removed variants other than Dark
+ Removed support for WMs and DEs other than GTK and Gnome Shell
+ Added Gedit theme
+ Added Code theme
+ Added Discord theme

## 3rd party extra
**Papirus Dark** icon pack and **Capitaine** cursors are a good combination to this theme.
